# boil

## What is it?

A boilerplate I use for all my node projects. It creates the `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`, `.jshintrc` files, among other things.

Check [marcooliveira/node-boilerplate-files](https://github.com/marcooliveira/node-boilerplate-files) for a list of everything that is set up for you.

## Installing

Run `npm install -g node-boil`.

## Usage

Just run `boil` in the folder you want to put the boilerplate in.
